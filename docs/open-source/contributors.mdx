## Introduction

### Setup your environnement

We made a docker file that builds Panora from sources, specifically to help you locally test your contributions. Here's how to use it.

<Info>Execute these from your Panora's repo root folder</Info>

<Steps>

<Step title="Copy env variables">```bash cp .env.example .env ```</Step>

<Step title="Removed previously installed dependencies">
  ```bash rm -rf node_modules .pnpm-store ./packages/api/dist
  ./packages/api/node_modules ./apps/webapp/node_modules
  ./apps/frontend_snippet/node_modules ```
</Step>

<Step title="Mac Users only:">
  ```bash echo -e "node-linker=hoisted\npackage-import-method=clone-or-copy" >
  .npmrc ```
</Step>

  <Step title="Start the Dockerfile">
      ```bash
        docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
      ```

That's all! You can find the backend and other services running at their usual location. Editing code locally will immediately reflect.

## Adding new Integrations ‚ú®

Make sure you are inside `packages/api/src` where the server lives !

# You want to add a new 3rd Party not yet supported ? üßë‚Äçüé§

_Ie: Slack, Hubspot, Jira, Shopify ..._

First choose wisely which vertical the 3rd party belongs to among these:

- crm
- ticketing
- accounting
- ats
- filestorage
- hris
- marketingautomation

For the sake of the guide, now on we'll consider adding a 3rd party belonging to the `crm` vertical.

## 1. Look into the `packages/shared/src/utils.ts` file and check if the provider you want to build has its metadata set inside the `providersConfig` object.

It should be available (if not contact Panora team) with active field set to false meaning the integration has not been built.

Actually an integration is built in 2 parts :

- the authentication part (oauth, api key, basic etc) which is built by the Panora team
- the service integration where the mapping is created with our unified model which is what you'll build

## 2. Build your provider service

# You want to map a common object to your new 3rd Party ? üë©‚Äçüé§

_Ie: Contact, Ticket, Deal, Company ..._

For the sake of this guide, let's map the common object `contact` under `crm` vertical to _my3rdParty_ (in reality it would be a real 3rd party name).

### DISCLAIMER: an integration is considered valid when all common objects have been mapped. Then, after the PR is accepted we'll be able to set `active` field to `true` inside `providersConfig`.

## 1. Add a new service to map your common object to your 3rd party

Create a new service folder with the name of your 3rd party. Let's call it _my3rdParty_.

`cd crm/contact/services/my3rdParty`

You'll now create 3 files.

`index.ts` \_where your service is created and direct interaction with your 3rd party API is handled

It must implement the `IContactService` interface.

```ts
export interface IContactService {
  addContact(
    contactData: DesunifyReturnType,
    linkedUserId: string
  ): Promise<ApiResponse<OriginalContactOutput>>;

  syncContacts(
    linkedUserId: string
  ): Promise<ApiResponse<OriginalContactOutput[]>>;
}
```

```ts
@Injectable()
export class My3rdPartyService implements IContactService {
  constructor(
    private prisma: PrismaService,
    private logger: LoggerService,
    private cryptoService: EncryptionService,
    private registry: ServiceRegistry,
  ) {
    this.logger.setContext(
      CrmObject.contact.toUpperCase() + ':' + My3rdPartyService.name,
    );
    this.registry.registerService('my3rdParty', this);
  }
  async addContact(
    contactData: 3rdPartyContactInput,
    linkedUserId: string,
  ): Promise<ApiResponse<3rdPartyContactOutput>> {}

  async syncContacts(
    linkedUserId: string,
  ): Promise<ApiResponse<3rdPartyContactOutput[]>> {}
}
```

Check other implementations under `/crm/contacts/services` to fill the core functions.

The keen readers may have noticed `3rdPartyContactInput` and `3rdPartyContactOutput`.

This is where `types.ts` comes in:

Go to the 3rd party API and insert the correct types asked by the API.

```ts
export interface 3rdPartyContact {
    //INSERT THE CORRECT TYPE HERE
}
export type 3rdPartyContactInput = Partial<3rdPartyContact>;
export type 3rdPartyContactOutput = 3rdPartyContactInput;
```

Last but not least, inside `mappers.ts` you have to build the mappings between our unified common object `contact` and your third party specific type `3rdPartyContact`.

It must implement `IContactMapper` interface.

```ts
export interface IContactMapper {
  desunify(
    source: UnifiedContactInput,
    customFieldMappings?: {
      slug: string;
      remote_id: string;
    }[]
  ): DesunifyReturnType;

  unify(
    source: OriginalContactOutput | OriginalContactOutput[],
    customFieldMappings?: {
      slug: string;
      remote_id: string;
    }[]
  ): UnifiedContactOutput | UnifiedContactOutput[];
}
```

```ts
export class My3rdPartyMapper implements IContactMapper {
  desunify(
    source: UnifiedContactInput,
    customFieldMappings?: {
      slug: string;
      remote_id: string;
    }[],
  ): 3rdPartyContactInput {}

  unify(
    source: 3rdPartyContactOutput | 3rdPartyContactOutput[],
    customFieldMappings?: {
      slug: string;
      remote_id: string;
    }[],
  ): UnifiedContactOutput | UnifiedContactOutput[] {}
}
```

Check other implementations under `/crm/contacts/services` to fill the core functions.

## 2. Enable your new service

To make sure the service is enabled, dependencies and imports must be added.
We built a script that does it in seconds.

`pnpm run validate-connectors --vertical="crm" --objectType="contact"`

The script will automatically scan the `/crm/contact/services` folder and detect any new service folder so all dependencies and imports are updated across the codebase.

### Congrats Hero ! ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### You now have built a new integration with Panora

### NB: The development kit to add integrations out of the blue is coming soon üé∏
